# Valentine's Day Interactive Web Page

## Project Description

This is a fun and engaging Valentine's Day interactive web page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user is presented with a question: "Will you be my Valentine?" and two buttons: "Yes" and "No".

- If the user clicks "Yes", a romantic music starts playing and the "No" button disappears.
- If the user clicks "No", the button becomes larger and displays messages encouraging the user to choose "Yes".
- After several attempts to click "No", the button eventually disappears, leaving only the "Yes" button, ensuring the user has to click "Yes" eventually.

This project showcases basic DOM manipulation and event handling to create an amusing and interactive user experience.

## Features

- Interactive buttons with dynamic behavior
- Romantic music playback upon clicking "Yes"
- Encouraging messages when clicking "No"
- Simple yet effective animations
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
